## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture adapted for a RESTful API backend with a decoupled frontend.

### Request Flow

Every user interaction follows this path:

1. User opens coaching-pj.vercel.app in their browser
2. Browser loads public/index.html — the entire frontend UI
3. User enters credentials; Supabase Auth verifies and returns a JWT token
4. Frontend stores the token in memory and includes it in every API request
5. Express server receives the request and runs the authenticate() middleware
6. Middleware verifies the JWT with Supabase Auth
7. If valid, the request passes to the appropriate controller
8. Controller queries the Supabase PostgreSQL database
9. Database returns data; controller formats and sends the JSON response
10. Frontend renders the data as HTML in the browser

### Frontend vs Backend

| Component       | Location               | Runs In           | Visible to Users    |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| index.html      | public/index.html      | User's browser    | Yes — the entire UI |
| server.js       | src/server.js          | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Controllers     | src/controllers/       | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Routes          | src/routes/            | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Middleware      | src/middleware/        | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Supabase config | src/config/supabase.js | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |

## Database Design

The database is hosted on Supabase (PostgreSQL). All tables use UUID primary keys generated by Supabase automatically. Row Level Security (RLS) was intentionally disabled to allow the service role key to manage all records server-side.

### Tables

| Table            | Purpose                    | Key Fields                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| users            | Authenticated system users | id, email, name, role                                                      |
| customers        | CRM customer records       | id, first_name, last_name, email, company, status, total_spent, owner_id   |
| leads            | Sales pipeline leads       | id, first_name, last_name, stage, score, estimated_value, source, owner_id |
| appointments     | Scheduled meetings         | id, title, type, customer_id, scheduled_at, duration_min, status, owner_id |
| activities       | Audit log of actions       | id, entity_type, entity_id, user_id, action, metadata                      |
| analytics_events | Custom GA event log        | id, event_name, event_data, session_id, user_agent                         |

### Customer Status Values

- **active** — currently engaged client
- **vip** — high-value client
- **at_risk** — client showing signs of churn
- **inactive** — no recent engagement
- **churned** — lost client

### Lead Pipeline Stages

Leads move through 6 stages representing the sales journey:

| Stage       | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| new         | Freshly added lead, no contact made yet |
| discovery   | Initial conversation underway           |
| qualified   | Lead confirmed as a genuine opportunity |
| proposal    | Formal proposal or quote sent           |
| closed_won  | Deal successfully closed                |
| closed_lost | Lead did not convert                    |

## API Reference

All API endpoints follow RESTful conventions. Every request (except authentication) requires a valid Supabase JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

| POST   | /api/analytics/track     | Log a custom frontend analytics event (no auth required)                  |

## Frontend Application

The entire frontend lives in a single file: [public/index.html](public/index.html). It is a Single-Page Application (SPA) that dynamically renders content without any page reloads. All UI transitions, data fetching, and state management are handled in vanilla JavaScript.

### Dashboard Sections

| Section               | What It Shows                                                      | Data Source                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| KPI Cards (top row)   | Total Revenue, Customer Count, Active Leads, Upcoming Appointments | Customers + Leads + Appointments tables           |
| Revenue / Month Chart | Bar chart of monthly revenue based on customer creation date       | customers.total_spent grouped by created_at month |
| Customer Status Donut | Visual breakdown of customers by status                            | Customers table                                   |
| Upcoming Appointments | Next 5 scheduled/confirmed appointments                            | Appointments with status = scheduled or confirmed |
| Top Leads             | Top 5 leads by score with visual score bar                         | Leads sorted by score descending                  |

### Pages

| Page         | Features                                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard    | KPI cards, revenue chart, customer donut, upcoming appointments, top leads         |
| Customers    | Sortable table with name, company, email, status badge, total spent, delete button |
| Leads        | Kanban pipeline board by stage + full leads table with score bars                  |
| Appointments | Table with title, customer name, type, status, date/time, duration, delete         |
| Analytics    | 4 KPI cards + pipeline value bar chart by stage                                    |

### Key JavaScript Functions

| Function                       | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| doLogin()                      | Authenticates user via Supabase, stores JWT token in memory            |
| apiFetch(path, options)        | Wrapper for all API calls — automatically attaches the auth token      |
| navigate(page, el)             | Switches between pages, fires GA page_view event                       |
| loadDashboard()                | Fetches all three data sets in parallel, renders all dashboard widgets |
| loadCustomers()                | Fetches and renders the customers table                                |
| loadLeads()                    | Fetches leads, renders both the pipeline board and the table           |
| loadAppointments()             | Fetches and renders the appointments table                             |
| loadAnalytics()                | Calls both analytics endpoints, renders KPI cards and pipeline chart   |
| confirmDelete(type, id, label) | Opens confirmation dialog before any delete operation                  |
| executeDelete()                | Sends DELETE request, reloads the relevant table on success            |
| handleSearch(query)            | Client-side search filter on already-loaded customer or lead data      |

## Security Implementation

### Authentication

Authentication is handled entirely by Supabase Auth. When a user logs in, Supabase validates their credentials and returns a signed JWT token. Every subsequent API request from the browser includes this token in the Authorization header. The server's authenticate() middleware verifies the token with Supabase on every protected route before allowing access.

### Security Headers (Helmet.js)

Helmet.js sets the following HTTP security headers on every response:

| Header                        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Security-Policy (CSP) | Restricts which scripts, styles, fonts, and connections are allowed       |
| X-Frame-Options               | Prevents the app from being embedded in iframes (clickjacking protection) |
| X-Content-Type-Options        | Prevents MIME type sniffing                                               |
| Referrer-Policy               | Controls what referrer information is sent with requests                  |
| Strict-Transport-Security     | Enforces HTTPS connections                                                |

### Rate Limiting

The express-rate-limit middleware limits all /api/ routes to 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP address. The /health endpoint is excluded. On Vercel, the trust proxy setting is enabled to correctly identify client IP addresses behind the proxy layer.

### Input Validation

All POST and PATCH routes run through express-validator middleware before reaching the controller. Invalid requests return a 422 Unprocessable Content response with field-level error details. The appointment route validates that customer_id is a valid UUID, scheduled_at is ISO 8601 format, and type is one of the allowed values.

### Environment Variables

All sensitive credentials are stored as environment variables — never in code. The following variables are required:

| Variable                  | Where Set     | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SUPABASE_URL              | Vercel + .env | Supabase project endpoint URL        |
| SUPABASE_ANON_KEY         | Vercel + .env | Public key for browser-side auth     |
| SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY | Vercel only   | Server-side key that bypasses RLS    |
| CORS_ORIGIN               | Vercel + .env | Allowed frontend origin for CORS     |
| NODE_ENV                  | Vercel + .env | Environment (production/development) |

## Analytics & Tracking

### Google Analytics 4 Setup

Google Analytics 4 is integrated via the gtag.js library loaded in the HTML head. The Measurement ID is G-VQ0X3XKHBQ. The GA stream is configured to receive traffic from https://coaching-pj.vercel.app.

### What Is Tracked

| Event               | When It Fires                  | Type                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| page_view (auto)    | On initial app load            | Automatic                               |
| page_view (SPA)     | Every sidebar navigation click | Custom — fires in navigate()            |
| login               | On successful sign in          | Custom                                  |
| customer_created    | When a new customer is saved   | Custom                                  |
| lead_created        | When a new lead is saved       | Custom                                  |
| appointment_created | When an appointment is booked  | Custom                                  |
| record_deleted      | When any record is deleted     | Custom — includes record_type parameter |

### Where to View Data in GA

- Reports > Realtime — active users right now
- Reports > Engagement > Pages and Screens — most visited pages
- Reports > Engagement > Events — custom event counts
- Reports > Acquisition — traffic sources
- Reports > Retention — returning vs new users

### Current GA Results

Since deployment in April 2026 the platform has recorded:

- 11 active users
- 9 new users
- 158 total events
- 2 minutes 49 seconds average engagement time per session
- Most visited page: Customers (16 views)

## Deployment & DevOps

### Vercel Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel at https://coaching-pj.vercel.app. The vercel.json configuration routes all traffic through src/server.js as a serverless function. Every push to the main branch on GitHub triggers an automatic production deployment.

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml pipeline runs on every push and pull request:

1. ESLint runs to check code quality
2. Jest tests run on Node.js 18 and 20
3. npm audit checks for security vulnerabilities
4. If all checks pass, Vercel deploys to production automatically

### Environment Configuration

Five environment variables are configured in Vercel under Project Settings > Environment Variables, all set to All Environments (Production, Preview, Development):

- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- CORS_ORIGIN
- NODE_ENV

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Anesu-Chinyangare/coaching-pj.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Fill in your Supabase credentials in `.env`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open http://localhost:3000

## Testing

The project includes a Jest + Supertest test suite. Tests can be run locally or are triggered automatically by the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests with coverage
npm run lint      # Run ESLint code quality checks
```

### Manual API Testing

The api.http file in the project root can be used with the VS Code REST Client extension to manually test all API endpoints. Replace the placeholder JWT token with a real token from the Supabase dashboard and run any request with a single click.

### Available npm Scripts

| Command      | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| npm run dev  | Start server with nodemon (auto-restart on file save) |
| npm start    | Start production server                               |
| npm test     | Run Jest tests with coverage report                   |
| npm run lint | Run ESLint on all source files                        |
| npm run seed | Populate database with sample data                    |

## Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Invalid Database Joins Crashing All API Routes

All three controllers (customers, leads, appointments) used Supabase relational joins like `.select('*, owner:users(id, name)')` which required foreign key relationships that did not exist in the database schema. This caused every GET and POST request to return a 500 error.

**Solution:** Removed all relational joins from the controllers and replaced them with simple `.select('*')` queries, fetching only the data directly available in each table.

### Challenge 2: Supabase Foreign Key Constraint Blocking Record Creation

Creating customers returned a 500 error with the message "insert or update on table customers violates foreign key constraint customers_owner_id_fkey". The owner_id field required a matching record in the users table but that table was empty even though the Supabase Auth user existed.

**Solution:** Inserted the authenticated user's UUID manually into the users table via the Supabase SQL Editor, linking the Auth user to the application's users table.

### Challenge 3: Content Security Policy Blocking Google Analytics

Google Analytics was integrated but showed zero data in the Realtime dashboard even though the tracking tag was correctly installed. The browser console showed "Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy."

**Solution:** Updated the connectSrc directive in the Helmet.js CSP configuration in src/server.js to explicitly allow:

- https://analytics.google.com
- https://www.googletagmanager.com
- https://region1.google-analytics.com

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture adapted for a RESTful API backend with a decoupled frontend.

### Request Flow

Every user interaction follows this path:

1. User opens coaching-pj.vercel.app in their browser
2. Browser loads public/index.html — the entire frontend UI
3. User enters credentials; Supabase Auth verifies and returns a JWT token
4. Frontend stores the token in memory and includes it in every API request
5. Express server receives the request and runs the authenticate() middleware
6. Middleware verifies the JWT with Supabase Auth
7. If valid, the request passes to the appropriate controller
8. Controller queries the Supabase PostgreSQL database
9. Database returns data; controller formats and sends the JSON response
10. Frontend renders the data as HTML in the browser

### Frontend vs Backend

| Component       | Location               | Runs In           | Visible to Users    |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| index.html      | public/index.html      | User's browser    | Yes — the entire UI |
| server.js       | src/server.js          | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Controllers     | src/controllers/       | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Routes          | src/routes/            | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Middleware      | src/middleware/        | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |
| Supabase config | src/config/supabase.js | Vercel serverless | No — server only    |

## Database Design

The database is hosted on Supabase (PostgreSQL). All tables use UUID primary keys generated by Supabase automatically. Row Level Security (RLS) was intentionally disabled to allow the service role key to manage all records server-side.

### Tables

| Table            | Purpose                    | Key Fields                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| users            | Authenticated system users | id, email, name, role                                                      |
| customers        | CRM customer records       | id, first_name, last_name, email, company, status, total_spent, owner_id   |
| leads            | Sales pipeline leads       | id, first_name, last_name, stage, score, estimated_value, source, owner_id |
| appointments     | Scheduled meetings         | id, title, type, customer_id, scheduled_at, duration_min, status, owner_id |
| activities       | Audit log of actions       | id, entity_type, entity_id, user_id, action, metadata                      |
| analytics_events | Custom GA event log        | id, event_name, event_data, session_id, user_agent                         |

### Customer Status Values

- **active** — currently engaged client
- **vip** — high-value client
- **at_risk** — client showing signs of churn
- **inactive** — no recent engagement
- **churned** — lost client

### Lead Pipeline Stages

Leads move through 6 stages representing the sales journey:

| Stage       | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| new         | Freshly added lead, no contact made yet |
| discovery   | Initial conversation underway           |
| qualified   | Lead confirmed as a genuine opportunity |
| proposal    | Formal proposal or quote sent           |
| closed_won  | Deal successfully closed                |
| closed_lost | Lead did not convert                    |

## API Reference

All API endpoints follow RESTful conventions. Every request (except authentication) requires a valid Supabase JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

## Frontend Application

The entire frontend lives in a single file: [public/index.html](public/index.html). It is a Single-Page Application (SPA) that dynamically renders content without any page reloads. All UI transitions, data fetching, and state management are handled in vanilla JavaScript.

### Dashboard Sections

| Section               | What It Shows                                                      | Data Source                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |

| handleSearch(query)            | Client-side search filter on already-loaded customer or lead data      |

## Security Implementation

### Authentication

Authentication is handled entirely by Supabase Auth. When a user logs in, Supabase validates their credentials and returns a signed JWT token. Every subsequent API request from the browser includes this token in the Authorization header. The server's authenticate() middleware verifies the token with Supabase on every protected route before allowing access.

### Security Headers (Helmet.js)

Helmet.js sets the following HTTP security headers on every response:

| Header                        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Security-Policy (CSP) | Restricts which scripts, styles, fonts, and connections are allowed       |
| X-Frame-Options               | Prevents the app from being embedded in iframes (clickjacking protection) |
| X-Content-Type-Options        | Prevents MIME type sniffing                                               |
| Referrer-Policy               | Controls what referrer information is sent with requests                  |
| Strict-Transport-Security     | Enforces HTTPS connections                                                |

### Rate Limiting

The express-rate-limit middleware limits all /api/ routes to 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP address. The /health endpoint is excluded. On Vercel, the trust proxy setting is enabled to correctly identify client IP addresses behind the proxy layer.

### Input Validation

All POST and PATCH routes run through express-validator middleware before reaching the controller. Invalid requests return a 422 Unprocessable Content response with field-level error details. The appointment route validates that customer_id is a valid UUID, scheduled_at is ISO 8601 format, and type is one of the allowed values.

### Environment Variables

All sensitive credentials are stored as environment variables — never in code. The following variables are required:

| Variable                  | Where Set     | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SUPABASE_URL              | Vercel + .env | Supabase project endpoint URL        |
| SUPABASE_ANON_KEY         | Vercel + .env | Public key for browser-side auth     |
| SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY | Vercel only   | Server-side key that bypasses RLS    |
| CORS_ORIGIN               | Vercel + .env | Allowed frontend origin for CORS     |
| NODE_ENV                  | Vercel + .env | Environment (production/development) |

- 11 active users
- 9 new users
- 158 total events
- 2 minutes 49 seconds average engagement time per session
- Most visited page: Customers (16 views)

## Deployment & DevOps

### Vercel Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel at https://coaching-pj.vercel.app. The vercel.json configuration routes all traffic through src/server.js as a serverless function. Every push to the main branch on GitHub triggers an automatic production deployment.

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml pipeline runs on every push and pull request:

1. ESLint runs to check code quality
2. Jest tests run on Node.js 18 and 20
3. npm audit checks for security vulnerabilities
4. If all checks pass, Vercel deploys to production automatically

### Environment Configuration

Five environment variables are configured in Vercel under Project Settings > Environment Variables, all set to All Environments (Production, Preview, Development):

- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- CORS_ORIGIN
- NODE_ENV

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Anesu-Chinyangare/coaching-pj.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Fill in your Supabase credentials in `.env`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open http://localhost:3000

## Testing

The project includes a Jest + Supertest test suite. Tests can be run locally or are triggered automatically by the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests with coverage
npm run lint      # Run ESLint code quality checks
```

### Manual API Testing

The api.http file in the project root can be used with the VS Code REST Client extension to manually test all API endpoints. Replace the placeholder JWT token with a real token from the Supabase dashboard and run any request with a single click.

### Available npm Scripts

| Command      | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| npm run dev  | Start server with nodemon (auto-restart on file save) |
| npm start    | Start production server                               |
| npm test     | Run Jest tests with coverage report                   |
| npm run lint | Run ESLint on all source files                        |
| npm run seed | Populate database with sample data                    |

## Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Invalid Database Joins Crashing All API Routes

All three controllers (customers, leads, appointments) used Supabase relational joins like `.select('*, owner:users(id, name)')` which required foreign key relationships that did not exist in the database schema. This caused every GET and POST request to return a 500 error.

**Solution:** Removed all relational joins from the controllers and replaced them with simple `.select('*')` queries, fetching only the data directly available in each table.

### Challenge 2: Supabase Foreign Key Constraint Blocking Record Creation

Creating customers returned a 500 error with the message "insert or update on table customers violates foreign key constraint customers_owner_id_fkey". The owner_id field required a matching record in the users table but that table was empty even though the Supabase Auth user existed.

**Solution:** Inserted the authenticated user's UUID manually into the users table via the Supabase SQL Editor, linking the Auth user to the application's users table.

### Challenge 3: Content Security Policy Blocking Google Analytics

Google Analytics was integrated but showed zero data in the Realtime dashboard even though the tracking tag was correctly installed. The browser console showed "Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy."

**Solution:** Updated the connectSrc directive in the Helmet.js CSP configuration in src/server.js to explicitly allow:

- https://analytics.google.com
- https://www.googletagmanager.com
- https://region1.google-analytics.com
